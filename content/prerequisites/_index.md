# Getting Started

To start the workshop, follow one of the below links depending on whether you are...

* ...[running the workshop on your own (in your own account)](self_paced/_index.md)
* ...[attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)](aws_event/_index.md)

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**Create a Workspace**](getting-started.md)
